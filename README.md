## ABOUT

Senior Java Backend Engineer with 12+ years of commercial experience, working across small and large teams
(up to 40 engineers) in both remote and on-site environments.

Experienced in mentoring engineers and taking on team lead responsibilities. Owned and evolved
microservices-based architectures, including refactoring monolithic systems into independently deployable
services.

Designed RESTful APIs, built event-driven systems using Apache Kafka, and made key architectural decisions
to ensure scalability, low latency, and stability under high-load conditions.

Delivered the full software development lifecycle — from product owner requirements to fully automated
CI/CD pipelines with high test coverage, observability, and production-grade analytics.

Actively engaged in professional growth through algorithmic problem solving (LeetCode), participation
in Java conferences, and delivering internal technical talks.
